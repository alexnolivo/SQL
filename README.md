# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that I have completed as part of my learning journey. Each project includes a description of the problem statement, the data used, the SQL queries written to solve the problem, and the results obtained.

## Projects
Here is a list of projects included in this portfolio:

**
- Project 1: Analysis of Coffee Shop Inventory**

Each project is organized into its own folder, with a separate README file containing more details about the project.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server

## How to Run the Projects
To run the projects in this portfolio, you will need to have a SQL database management system installed. Each project folder contains a SQL script file that you can use to create the necessary database tables and populate them with data. You can then run the SQL queries to analyze the data and answer the project questions.

## Conclusion
I hope you find my SQL portfolio useful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me: **alexandranolivo@gmail.com**
